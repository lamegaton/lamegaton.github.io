1. First let look at the size:  
Usually, I will stick with 24" which has enough room for web browsing   

2. Resolution:  
I used 1920 x 1080 on 24" screen which is consider Full HD and it's great
The higher resolution, the more expensive

3.Types of panel:  

   | IPS                                              | TN                                                           | VA             | OLED     |
   | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |
   | Recommended, if possible get higher refresh rate | Cheap, high refreshing rate for gamming but not good in generall | better than TN | the best |

4. Refresh rate: 60Hz is good enough  
5. Response time: equal or less than 4ms  
6. Ports: HDMI
