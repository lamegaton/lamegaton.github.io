Have you ever felt anxious and spent many hours on looking for an electronic product? I have the same issue. One of the reason is because of the emerging technology and marketing strategy. But do we really need all of the new features? Actually not. To limit your options, please ask yourself "What do I really want from a \<product\>?". For a monitor, I will need a size big enough so I can code on one side and browsing web on the other side to search for solutions. I also want the resolution high enough so I don't see the big pixel. The last thing is HDMI port over older ports such as DVI or VGA

1. First let look at the size  
Usually, I will stick with 24" which has enough room for web browsing   
  
2. Resolution  
I used 1920 x 1080 on 24" screen which is consider Full HD and it's great  
The higher resolution, the more expensive

3. Types of panel  

   | IPS                                              | TN                                                           | VA             | OLED     |
   | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |
   | Recommended, if possible get higher refresh rate | Cheap, high refreshing rate for gamming but not good in generall | better than TN | the best |

4. Refresh rate: 60Hz is good enough  
5. Response time: equal or less than 4ms  
6. Ports: HDMI
