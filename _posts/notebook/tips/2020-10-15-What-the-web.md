Most web browsers are based on WebKit. When we type in a website URL such as `www.google.com` and hit enter, the browser acts as a middleman or a browser engine. It communicates with the Google server and requests the HTML-CSS files necessary for displaying the webpage.

Once the server hands over the necessary files, the browser engine passes them on to a rendering engine, which is like a cook. The rendering engine processes the files and creates a visual representation of the webpage. Finally, the rendering engine sends the completed webpage back to the browser engine, which then displays it to us.

There are couple things to explore:  

1. WebKit  
2. Browser Engine  
3. Server
4. User Interface
5. Rendering Engines

(to be cont. when I get wiser...)
