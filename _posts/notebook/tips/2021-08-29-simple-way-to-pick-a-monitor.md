Have you ever found yourself feeling anxious and spending countless hours researching an electronic product? I know the feeling all too well. The emergence of new technology and marketing strategies can make it challenging to determine what we really need in a product. However, it's important to ask ourselves, "What do I truly want from this product?" to help limit our options.  

For instance, when selecting a monitor, I require a size that's big enough to enable me to code on one side and browse the web on the other to search for solutions. Additionally, I prefer a high enough resolution that prevents me from seeing pixelation. Lastly, I prefer having HDMI ports instead of older ports such as DVI or VGA.

**Size**: usually, I will stick with **24"** which has enough room for web browsing   
**Resolution**: I used **1920 x 1080** on **24"** screen which is consider Full HD and it's great. The higher resolution, the more expensive

**Types of panel**

**IPS**: Recommended, if possible get higher refresh rate  
**TN**: Cheap, high refreshing rate for gamming but not good in generall  
**VA**: better than TN  
**OLED**: the best  

**Refresh rate**: 60Hz is good enough
**Response time**: equal or less than 4ms
**Ports**: HDMI
