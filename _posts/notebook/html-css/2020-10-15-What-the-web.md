Hi guys, 

What is the web actually? How do our browsers show us a webpage?  
As you already known, web browsers  are based on WebKit.
The browser is like the middle man (Browser Engine). When we type www.google.com and hit enter (User Interface), the browser will go to google server and ask for HTML-CSS files. Google server will hand those files to that middle man. Then the middle man will give it to a cook (Rendering Engine). Finally, the cook will display the dish back to middle man, then to us.  

(to be cont. when I get wiser...)
