Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$ S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} $$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$
  
$$
  X = 10 \log(\frac{P2}{P1})
$$

Type math within a sentence $$2x^2 + x + c$$ to display inline  

$$
  \bar{y} = {1 \over n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_i
$$

\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

 {% raw %}
  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! 
 {% endraw %}
