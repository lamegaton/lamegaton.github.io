Second, I’ll prioritize the items on the list based on their importance.  Finally, I’ll start working on the tasks and check them off the list as I go.  Next, I’ll focus on completing the most urgent tasks on the list.  Then, I’ll take a break and grab some lunch before continuing with my work.  To begin with, I’d like to thank everyone for coming to the meeting today.  After the meeting, we can discuss any follow-up tasks that need to be completed.  Before we get started, let’s review the agenda for today’s meeting.  As soon as I finish this project, I’ll be able to take some time off and go on vacation.  In the end, I was able to finish all of the tasks on my list and feel a great sense of accomplishment.  Gradually, I’ve been making progress towards my goal and feel more confident each day.results  As a result, he missed his flight and had to reschedule for the next day.  I am busy today, so I won’t be able to join you for lunch.  The project is behind schedule, accordingly, we need to increase our efforts to catch up.  She didn’t study for the exam, consequently, she failed it.  He forgot his phone at home, thus, he couldn’t check his emails.  Since it’s raining outside, we’ll have to cancel the outdoor picnic.  He didn’t wear a helmet while riding his bike, therefore, he was injured in the accident.  The software crashed repeatedly, for this reason, we need to update it.  He couldn’t attend the meeting, because of this, he missed important information.purpose  For this purpose, I have prepared a detailed plan of action.  With this in mind, we need to consider all the possible outcomes before making a decision.  I cannot attend the meeting today. For this reason, I will be sending my colleague in my place.example  I have several hobbies, such as painting, playing guitar, and hiking.  I enjoy traveling to different countries, for instance, I recently went to Japan and fell in love with the culture.  There are many reasons why people should exercise, to illustrate, it can improve physical and mental health, boost energy levels, and reduce stress.  I need a new laptop, for example, I need it to have a long battery life and be lightweight for easy portability.  I want to make sure I’m being specific when I describe the project requirements to my team, so they can fully understand what is expected of them.  I love all kinds of music, but especially enjoy listening to jazz and classical music.conclude  In summary, the project was a success and achieved all of its objectives.  To sum up, the main points of the presentation are that we need to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction.  To repeat, we cannot proceed with the project until we receive further instructions from management.  Briefly, the report highlights the main challenges facing our industry and suggests potential solutions.  In short, we need to cut costs and increase productivity if we want to remain competitive.  Finally, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the success of this project.  On the whole, the feedback from customers has been positive, but there are some areas for improvement.  Therefore, we recommend that the company invest in new technology to improve efficiency.  As I have said, the proposal has the potential to generate significant revenue for the company.  In conclusion, the evidence presented supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by human activity.  As you can see, the chart clearly illustrates the upward trend in sales over the past year.",

        "content": "Today I will summarize the process of becoming an international student in Canada. And I hope you will have a great experience here!  Prep before the trip  At the airport 🛫  Phone service  Public transportation 🚍  Stores in town          Grocery      Home Decor      Coffee shops      Chain Restaurants      Hardware store        Library is fantastic 📖  Best wishes for all ❤️Prep before the tripFirstly, I obtained a bachelor’s degree from a university in the US. While working, I prepared my application for a study permit and applied for graduate school in Canada. After submitting my biometric information, paying the required fee, and providing supporting documents, the embassy sent me a letter of introduction. This allowed me to obtain my study permit and begin my studies in Canada. Now you are relieved with paperwork. Let’s pack up and go. Before you book an airplane ticket please note that if you transit in the US, you must have a transit visa or travel visa. And don’t forget to bring some cash before your flight. Next, I will talk about the process at the airport.At the airport 🛫After arriving at the airport, you will need to proceed to an automated booth. Here, you will be required to scan your passport and answer some declaration questions. The booth will capture your photo, and it will print out a declaration paper that must kept. If you’re a new student, you will have to join the queue for an interview. During your turn, the officer will request your letter of introduction, school offer letter, and proof of payment for your first term/semester. If everything is in order, the officer will hand out a Study Permit, and you will be free to leave. At the Toronto International Airport, near the luggage carousel, there is a SIN office where you can queue up to obtain a SIN for future employment.Phone serviceThe next requirement would be to acquire a phone number. In Canada, there are numerous carriers to choose from. It is worth noting that mobile plans offered by major corporations like Rogers and Tellus are usually costly. Nevertheless, there are alternative options such as affordable plans or promotional offers available on Facebook Marketplace.Public transportation 🚍Now, you are able to live in Canada. Let’s go shopping and get some stuff for your room. There are a few public transportation options available in Waterloo such as GRT bus, ION bus, inter-city bus services (Flix Bus and OneX), GO bus, train, and VIA Rail train.For traveling within the city limits, GRT bus is a convenient and affordable option. Each trip costs approximately $3, and you can continue traveling for 90 minutes without being charged again.  1-minute break… “Coffee does taste better after you warm it up!”If you’re already familiar with how to take public transportation, I’ll briefly summarize the process. First, enter the bus through the front door. Second, tap your GRT card (easyGo) on the dashboard to pay your fare. It’s important to note that buses typically don’t accept credit cards, so make sure to have your easyGo handy.You can use Google Maps to help navigate your route and plan your journey. When it’s time to leave the bus, simply press the stop button or pull the yellow cord located by the windows to signal the driver.Stores in townThe list of a few stores that you can check out is below. Some stores in Canada are similar to ones in the US. Here we have:Grocery  Walmart  Sobeys  Bulk ban  Zehrs  Dutchies: farmer market  T &amp;T: this is Asian store that is similar to 99 Ranch in the US.Home Decor  Homesense  Bricks  HomeDepot  LowesCoffee shops  Starbucks  Tim HortonChain Restaurants  A&amp;W Burger: this is similar to McDonald’sHardware store  Princess Auto: is known for Harbour Freight in Canada  Canadian TireLibrary is fantastic 📖If you need to print documents, you can visit a local library. They will ask you to provide an ID and proof of your address and name. Usually, you will be given a free library card. The cost for printing is 0.25 cents for grayscale and 0.50 cents for color prints. Waterloo library has many great online services such as Practicing IELTs, access to O’Reilly books,…Best wishes for all ❤️Feeling comfortable in your room is key to helping you settle into your new environment and minimizing homesickness. By creating a cozy and inviting space, you’ll be able to relax and feel more at home. Not only will this contribute to your overall well-being, but it can also improve your productivity.I hope you have a fantastic trip or stay in Canada!",

Consequently, unlike Knit, Preview does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. ## Function In this case dot is a part of the variable’s namesay.hello &lt;- function(){  return(print(&#39;hello world&#39;))}say.hello()## [1] &quot;hello world&quot;add argument/input for the function also we can set the default argumentsay.something &lt;- function(somethingWhat=&quot;hello world&quot;){  return(print(somethingWhat))}say.something()## [1] &quot;hello world&quot;say.something(&#39;hello chucmap&#39;)## [1] &quot;hello chucmap&quot;ConditionalsSo we have traditional if…else statementisChucMapBeo &lt;- function(weight){  if(weight &gt;

        "content": "Have you ever found yourself feeling anxious and spending countless hours researching an electronic product? I know the feeling all too well. The emergence of new technology and marketing strategies can make it challenging to determine what we really need in a product. However, it’s important to ask ourselves, “What do I truly want from this product?” to help limit our options.For instance, when selecting a monitor, I require a size that’s big enough to enable me to code on one side and browse the web on the other to search for solutions. Additionally, I prefer a high enough resolution that prevents me from seeing pixelation. Lastly, I prefer having HDMI ports instead of older ports such as DVI or VGA.Size: usually, I will stick with 24” which has enough room for web browsing Resolution: I used 1920 x 1080 on 24” screen which is consider Full HD and it’s great. The higher resolution, the more expensiveTypes of panelIPS: Recommended, if possible get higher refresh rateTN: Cheap, high refreshing rate for gamming but not good in generallVA: better than TNOLED: the bestRefresh rate: 60Hz is good enoughResponse time: equal or less than 4msPorts: HDMI",

        "content": "Many of us have heard about decibel unit in our daily lives, as it can be used to describe the loudness of our speakers, the strength of our antennas, or the signal strength from a transceiver. But what exactly are decibels (dB) and dBm? In this discussion, let’s explore these concepts and expand our understanding.ExplanationDeci-bel is ten time of a Bel (10 x Bel)Bel is named after an inventor Alexander Graham Bell, in Bell Lab.It is an unit of a ratio on base 10 logarithm scaleBel is defined as \\(X = \\log\\frac{P2}{P1}\\)  P1: Reference Power  P2: Measured PowerNow we have \\(Decibel = 10 Bel = 10\\log\\frac{P2}{P1}\\)So what is the difference between dB and dBm?dBm stands for decibel in miliwat. That means, our Reference Power will be 1 mW\\[Y = 10 \\log\\frac{P2}{P1} = 10 \\log\\frac{P2}{1 mW}\\]We can find Y by raise them to the power of 10\\[10^{\\frac{Y}{10}} = 10^{\\log\\frac{P2}{1 mW}} =&gt; P2 = 10^{\\frac{Y}{10}} 1 mW\\]So in communication, we usually use dBm because we know the reference power which is 1 mW.Notice:Sometime, you will see SNR = 20log10(RMS(signal)/RMS(noise))So why do we have 20 here instead of 10?  As I understand, RMS is an amplitude value, and in this case we want to see the ratio in power.  Because power proportional to amplitude square so if we square both (RMS(signal)/RMS(noise)) we will get 20    In Summary:    dB, decibel is any ratio in term of base-10-logarithm, dimensionless unit.dBm, decibel-milliwatt is any ratio with 1 mW as a reference power, dimensioned unit.

While I knew that TCP had an error-checking procedure that made the protocol more reliable but slower than UDP, my understanding was limited. Although I had learned about the detailed structure of these protocols in school, I didn’t have a chance to get hands-on experience with them. However, I later discovered an easy way to explore TCP and UDP packets using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and WireShark.

This allows for a smoother user experience and faster loading times.It’s important to note that different web browsers may have different object names for handling asynchronous requests. For example, IE5 and IE6 use the ActiveXObject object, while modern browsers use the XMLHttpRequest object. Therefore, it’s important to use feature detection and check for the availability of these objects before making an asynchronous request to ensure compatibility across different browsers.function asynRequest(){\ttry {\t\tvar xhtml = new XMLHttpRequest()\t} catch {\t\ttry {\t\t\tsomething\t\t\t} catch {\t\t\t\tsomething different\t\t\t}\t\t}\t}}According to Mozilla, the XMLHttpRequest object does not require any parameters and will return after the open() and send() methods have been executed.Here’s a simple example of how to make an XMLHttpRequest:const request = new XMLHttpRequest();var url = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/2';//XMLHttpRequest.open(method, url[, async[, user[, password]]])request.open('GET',url,true);// every time the readyState property change, this (callback) funtion will be executedrequest.onreadystatechange = function() {    let status = request.status;    if (status === 0 || (status &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; status &lt; 400)) {      // The request has been completed successfully\t\tconsole.log(xhr.responseText);    } else {    \tconsole.log(\"Error!\");}",

        "content": "AxiosAxios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from a browser or Node.js. It provides a simple and elegant way to make asynchronous HTTP requests to a server, and handle responses in a clean and efficient manner.One common use case for Axios is to retrieve the content of a web page from a server. This can be achieved by sending a GET request to the server using Axios, and handling the response in the form of a promise.In this way, you can fetch data from a web page and use it in your application. Whether you need to retrieve data for a single page or multiple pages, Axios can simplify the process and help you manage your data more efficiently.axios.get({  method: 'get',  url: url,  responseType: 'stream'})  .then(function (response) {    // handle success    document.getElementById(\"result\").innerText = JSON.stringify(response.data);    document.getElementById(\"error_001\").innerText = response.data;    console.dir(response.data);  })  .catch(function (error) {    // handle error    console.log(error);  })  .then(function () {    // always executed  });    event.preventDefault();}, false);FetchFetch is a built-in web API in modern browsers that allows you to make HTTP requests to a server and retrieve data in a simple and straightforward way. It provides an alternative to the traditional XMLHttpRequest (XHR) API, and is designed to be easy to use and flexible.Fetch can retrieve the content of a web page from a server by sending a GET request to the server using the fetch() function, and handling the response in the form of a promise.It’s important to note that Fetch only works in modern browsers, and may not be supported in older versions. However, it offers several advantages over the XHR API, including a simpler API, support for Promises and async/await, and better handling of errors and response types.HTML&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div id=\"result\"&gt;If you don't have one, try this: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"url\" id=\"link_box\" placeholder=\"Please input the link\" value=\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"spacer\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button id=\"link_box_submit_btn\"&gt;Okay, here you go&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div id=\"error_001\"&gt;This is the error&lt;/div&gt;CSS#result{  padding: 10px;}#link_box, #link_box_submit_btn, #result, #error_001{  display: block;  margin: auto;  padding: 5px;  text-align: center;}#result{  width: 500px;}.spacer {  padding:5px;}JSdocument.querySelector(\"#link_box_submit_btn\").addEventListener(\"click\",  function (event) {    const url = document.getElementById(\"link_box\").value;    console.log(url);    document.getElementById(\"error_001\").innerText = url;    fetch(url, {      method: \"GET\",      mode: \"cors\",      headers: {        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"      }    })      .then((response) =&gt; response.json())      .then((data) =&gt; $(\"#result\").text(JSON.stringify(data)))      .catch((error) =&gt; console.log(\"Error:\",error));    event.preventDefault();  },  false);",

Here are the steps:  Create a new repo:    git init        Rename local branch:    git branch -m &lt;oldname&gt; &lt;newname&gt;        To check your local branch, you can use:    git branch        To check your remote branch, use:    git branch -r      If you invite someone to work with you on the project, they can clone your repo using:git clone &lt;https://link_to_your_repo&gt;They can create a new branch using:git branch &lt;lulu&gt;Then switch to the new branch using:git checkout luluWhen “lulu” tries to pull using “git pull”, they may encounter an error message like:There is no tracking information for the current branch.Please specify which branch you want to merge with.See git-pull(1) for details.In that case, they need to pull from “origin”.Another coworker creates a new branch called “lala”:git branch lalaWhen “lala” tries to pull and encounters the same error, they need to use “git branch” to find the default branch.Since working on the project, “lala” has made many contributions, so the manager wants to make the “lala” branch the default or “master” branch. To do this, “lala” needs to:  git add   git commit -m “what does lala do”Then the manager will:  git checkout master  git merge luluAnother scenario is if we assign “lala” to work on PHP side only.Tips:  If you’re tired of typing out commit, add, push separately, you can use a one-liner like this:    git commit -a -m \"commit\" &amp;&amp; git push      ",
