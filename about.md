Hi, my name is Son Pham. I'm an international student from Vietnam. Here's a brief timeline of my life journey:<br>
<strong>[01-17]</strong> : Had a wonderful time with my family in Vietnam.<br>
<strong>[17-18]</strong> : Joined Lutheran highschool, where I met great people such as Ms. Beyer and Mr. Meyer.<br>
<strong>[18-21]</strong> : Went to Southwestern College<br>
<strong>[21-24]</strong> : Joined a couple of clubs at San Diego State University and met people from different walks of life. Also worked at a company for the first time.<br>
Continue learning new skills: JavaScript, Angularjs, Bash, Shell, Perlâ€¦<br>
<strong>[24-25]</strong> : Left my job at Samsung and kept learning to find a more challenging one.<br>
<strong>[25-27]</strong> : Took a few quiet years to live.<br>
<strong>[28]</strong> : Went back to school again!!<br>
That's a quick summary of my life so far. I'm excited to see what the future holds!</p>
